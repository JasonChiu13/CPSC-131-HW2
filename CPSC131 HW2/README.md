# CPSC 131 HW2
### Group 13: Brenda Pham & Jason Chiu, Professor Ming Chen, Fall 2022

#### Instructions:
- Write a class named vector131. This class should behave like a dynamic array (able to resize).
- Include push_front(), push_back(), resize() and any other functions/data member that you think are necessary.
- You do not need to have complex constructors that would perfectly construct meaningful objects (in the real world you should. I am not requiring it because this takes a lot of work).
- You should have class prototype in one file, implementation in another file, and display functionalities of your vector131 class in your main function. Make good comments and write clean code.
- Google c++ style guide may be a useful resource for you. However, just search for sections you needed. It is not recommended to read the entire guide.
